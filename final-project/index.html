      <p class="headline"><a name="Start">A Timeline of <span style="color:#146eb4">Prime's</span> Success</p>
      <p class="byline">Almost half of U.S. households are Amazon Prime customers as of <br>Jan. 30, 2018, according to eMarketer.</p>
        <center><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime?_encoding=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0" target="_blank"><img src="images/amazon-prime-logo.png" class="prime-headline"></a></center>

      <center><div class="intro-text">It’s easy to forget what life was like before Amazon Prime. The e-commerce company has taken over the industry as it sells anything from clothing to cleaning supplies to food to a kitchen sick - literally. Once 2005 hit, the company made a drastic change and introduced a service that was first of a kind - Prime.</div></center>

      <div class="row">
        <h2><a name="The Beginning">The Beginning</a></h2><br>
            <p>In 2004, Amazon valued at $18 billion. Fast forward 15 years - Amazon’s worth is $900 billion. Most people credit the company’s success to the creation of Prime, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/3/18511544/amazon-prime-oral-history-jeff-bezos-one-day-shipping" target="_blank">according to an article in Vox.</a>
            <br></br>Back in February of 2005, founder, chairman, president and CEO of the company, Jeff Bezos, released a public letter, announcing the new membership program. For a flat rate of $79, Prime members get “all-you-can-eat” two-day shipping on all orders.
            <br></br>But what if you wanted the order to arrive the next day? No problem. Bezos has a solution - for just $3.99 per item, you can overnight it.</p>
            <center>
            <div class="first-photo">

            <figcaption>Bezos' letter to the public introducing Prime for the <br>first time. Credit: Vox</figcaption>
            <p>However, some workers at Amazon disagreed with Bezos’ original ideas regarding the membership service. Some thought that the shipping costs would grow far too expensive for the company to keep up with, according to Vox. Workers also raised concerns about actually fulfilling Prime’s promises relating to two-day shipping on all products.
            <br></br>“Very prominent people who are at Amazon today and in high positions told me, ‘You shouldn’t be allowing Jeff to do this,’ and, ‘This is setting a bad example for the company,’” Vijay Ravindran, former Amazon director of ordering, said in an interview with Vox. The original idea of Prime was to offer free shipping, but the order must have a $25 minimum and it takes about 10 days to ship.
            <br></br>Through frequent meetings, Bezos’ team bumped ideas off of each other to perfect Prime’s entire package. Finally, the former Amazon principal engineer, Charlie Ward, came up with the <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/3/18511544/amazon-prime-oral-history-jeff-bezos-one-day-shipping" target="_blank">idea </a>to create a flat rate that covered all shipping costs for an entire year.
            <br></br>And so, “all-you-can-eat” shipping was born.</p>

            <p>According to Vox, Bezos and his team revolutionized the e-commerce industry. Prime transformed the online shopping experience for members because it offers a variety of products that are easy to purchase. In just a few clicks, members could have almost any product sent to their doorstep in just two days.</p>

            <p>But that’s not all. During the last 14 years, Prime perks have increased. </p>

        <h2><a name="Prime Additions">Prime Additions</a></h2><br>
          <p>According to <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/nearly-half-of-us-households-are-now-amazon-prime-subscribers" target="_blank">eMarketer, </a>46% of Prime members purchase something on Amazon at least once per week. Amazon customers are more likely to purchase a product if they are already a Prime subscriber.

          <br></br>In 2018, <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/amazon-now-has-nearly-50-of-us-ecommerce-market" target="_blank">eMarketer </a>also reported that Amazon has the highest percentage of  U.S. e-commerce sales, with 49.1%. EBay trails behind, with only 6.6% of sales.

          <br></br>Some of these sales include electronics, apparel, accessories, furniture, toys, books, music and even movies.

          <br></br>“I don’t remember the last time I walked into a Barnes & Noble,” Amanda Franko, a neuroscience and physiology major at the University of Maryland, said. “I get all of my school supplies and textbooks through my Prime account.”

          <br></br>As Prime’s popularity grew since 2005, Bezos added many benefits to the membership. They include Prime Video, Prime Pantry, Prime Music, Prime Photos, Prime Now, Prime Reading and Prime Wardrobe.</p>

      <p>In particular, Prime Video is a crucial selling point for Amazon’s international customers. Prime members primarily in Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom have increased, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/03/04/10-charts-that-will-change-your-perspective-of-amazon-primes-growth/#72c3228f3fee" target="_blank">data </a>released by Morgan Stanley.

      <br></br>To account for all of these added benefits, the company decided to increase the membership fee by 25.32% back in March 2014. Despite the increase to $99 annually, this didn’t stop Prime subscribers from renewing another year. In fact, the Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) saw a high retention rate, regardless of the price.

      <br></br>“CIRP estimates that currently 73% of trial subscribers pay for the first full year of Amazon Prime membership. 91% of first-year paid subscribers renew for a second year, and 96% of second-year paid subscribers renew for a third year,” according to an <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amazon-prime-members-stay_b_10334678" target="_blank">article published by the HuffPost.</a></p>

      <!-- END first graphic container-->
      <p>After the increase in membership price, Prime started offering same-day delivery. On eligible orders, customers could receive their purchase later that same day.

      <br></br>“I depend on my Amazon Prime account for my everyday needs. I’m a music teacher, so it’s very easy for me to use Amazon as a way to get resources for the classroom in a timely and efficient manner, for an inexpensive price,” Alex Sanford, a music teacher based out of New Hampshire, said in a phone interview.

      <br></br>Prime also introduced the Amazon Key in October 2017, which allows customers to purchase a “Video Doorbell and Camera.”

      <br></br>“See who’s there. Then let them in.”

      <br></br>The doorbell allows customers to see the delivery worker drop and then can let them into their home to leave the package inside rather than outside.

      <br></br>And just about a year ago, Prime’s annual membership fee increased to $119.

      <br></br>One month prior to the 20.2% increase in price, Prime began offering trunk delivery. So now, you can not only get a package delivered to inside of your house, but also your car’s trunk is a new delivery spot.

      <br></br><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/546894/number-of-amazon-prime-paying-members/" target="_blank">CIRP and Statistica </a>released that in June 2017, there were 85 million U.S. Prime subscribers. That’s a 107.32% increase from March 2015.</p>

      <p>In 2017, Amazon acquired <a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/" target="_blank">Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM),</a> and through Prime Now, subscribers can grocery shop online at WFM with the option of one or two hour delivery.

      <br></br>But, customers still prefer to shop at different grocery stores because of the perception of higher prices at WFM, according to a study conducted by Morgan Stanley.

      <br></br>To break this perception and barrier to shopping at WFM, Prime is creating ways to attract more customers to shop at there through their attractive benefits offered in Prime Now. Some benefits include food sales, free two-day delivery and free same-day delivery in certain regions.</p>
